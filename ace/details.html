      <h1>About the event</h1>
        <p>The Annual Ace in the Hole Multisport Weekend is a legendary event in
the Oregon triathlon and running community. It has become a
traditional destination race for athletes from across the nation.</p>
        <p>There is something for every level of athletic ability. The weekend
includes a first timer triathlon, a sprint, Olympic, and Half-Iron
triathlons and 10K and Half marathon runs. Come to experience your
first race or come to compete to win, but make sure you come to have
fun!</p>
          <h2>What to Bring</h2>
            <p>
              Watch the weather closely. The show goes on no matter what the
weather is doing.
            </p>
        <p>You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event. You
will be given a band that will hold your chip timing piece around your
ankle throughout the entire event. Be sure that it is snapped tightly.
Be sure to have your Chip Timing piece on before you start the race
and be sure to step over the timing mats after each segment of the
race. If you are wearing a wet-suit, make sure the timing piece goes
under your wetsuit otherwise, you will have a very difficult time
getting off your wet suit.</p>
        <h2>Swim:</h2>
        <p>Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy
and warmth. However, many people opt for no wetsuit for a triathlon so
no worries. We will provide you with a swim cap but you will want to
bring your own goggles.</p>
        <h2>Bike:</h2>
        <p>A biking helmet is mandatory. You will also receive 2 stickers
in your package with your race number on them. The small sticker
should go on the front of your helmet. The bigger sticker will wrap
around your bike frame. Road or mountain bikes are acceptable. For
safety reasons, be sure to have end-caps on the end of your handlebars.</p>
        <h2>Run:</h2>
        <p>You must finish the race with your bib number on the front of
you. Some people choose to pin it on at the beginning of the race and
have it on for the whole event so they donít have to worry about it.
Others pin it on a singlet that they put on once they finish the swim
before they head out for the bike. Others use an elastic racing strap
that they pin their bib number to and then quickly strap it on before
they leave for the run. Use whatever option feels best for you.</p>
        <p>Remember to bring a change of clothing so you can enjoy the post-event
festivities.</p>
      <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p>What are the Rules? We currently adhere to the USAT Rules for
Triathlon & Duathlon. Important rules include no drafting, you must
wear a helmet and music is ABSOLUTELY NOT allowed during the bike for
obvious safety reasons.</p>
        <p>Can I use a personal music device while cycling? Absolutely no music
devices are allowed during the bike segment for obvious safety risks
and will result in immediate disqualification.</p>
        <p>Can I use a personal music device while running? During any running
segments, we prefer for athletes to NOT use music devices to maximize
safety, assure a fair competitive environment and assure athletes can
hear all course marshal instructions. With that said, we also
understand that many athletes rely on music to help endure the
challenge of running. To accommodate the needs of our athletes while
still assuring maximum safety and a fair, competitive environment,
here is the arrangement that we can accommodate.</p>
        <p>If you chose to use a personal music device, you must always keep
one ear open for instructions so only one ear-bud can be used at any
time. In addition, if you opt to use music, you will not be eligible
for awards, points and rankings. So as an athlete, you have to make a
choiceÖmusic or awards/points/rankings.</p>
        <p>If you are using a personal music device with two earbuds, you
will be immediately disqualified. Trust us, we donít want to have to
enforce a disqualification but in order to assure the safety of all
athletes, this is a very important rule.
We also request that if you chose to use a personal music device
that you keep the volume to a minimum to assure all instructions can
be heard.</p>
<p>Do I need to wear a wetsuit? No, you do not need to wear a wetsuit.
Many will not wear a wetsuit while others will choose to wear a
wetsuit because of the buoyancy and warmth factor.
Do I have to use a road or racing bike? No. We welcome any type of
bike as long as it is functioning properly with brakes and endcaps at
the end of your handlebars.</p>
